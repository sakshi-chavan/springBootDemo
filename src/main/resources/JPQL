JPQL - JAVA PERSISTENT QUERY LANGUAGE

- Similar syntax to SQL Query. Reference to entity class and fields inside it.

- The major difference between JPQL Query and SQL Query is that,
	in SQL Query, we refer to table and columns
	while in JPA Query, we refer to entity class and fields inside the entity class,
	as entity class is mapped with table and fields inside the entity class are mapped with columns.
	
- Why we need to write JPQL?
	Sometimes you need to write a query that you cannot achieve by method proxy which is provided by JPA.
	In this case,
	you will need to write JPQL.
	In JPQL - you will refer to entity class and fields inside the entity class then,
	That query will get converted into SQL query by JPA.
	In this case we can avoid writing SQL query.
